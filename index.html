          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>Everything we do is open source and replicable by volunteers. Our free workshops typically have waitlists, so we encourage anyone to replicate the events and to form new local chapters.  There's no need to ask permission if someone wants to create an event to teach other people technical skills.  We have curricula for a few languages and plenty of volunteers who will mentor new organizers or volunteer to teach at your event.  </p>
          <p>We think of new initiatives and events like the old folktale about <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/2009/10/stone-soup-workshop/">stone soup</a>.  A brave and passionate volunteer wants to diversify their community or create a community that will help them learn a new skill and we help find others who will make that happen or simply provide information about what has worked before and cheer them on!</p>
